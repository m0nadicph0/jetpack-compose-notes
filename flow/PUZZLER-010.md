## Puzzler 010: Collaborative Editing with Conflict Resolution

**Description:**

This exercise challenges you to implement a collaborative editing feature where multiple users can edit a document simultaneously. Utilize Flows in the ViewModel to manage data synchronization and handle potential conflicts between concurrent edits.

**Problem Specification:**

* Develop a screen displaying a shared document content.
* Allow multiple users to edit the document in real-time.
* Implement a mechanism to synchronize document changes across users using Flows.
* Detect and handle potential conflicts when multiple users edit the same part of the document simultaneously.
* Provide appropriate feedback to users about conflicts and offer resolution options.

**Focus:**

* Understanding advanced Flow manipulation for complex interactions and state management.
* Implementing conflict resolution mechanisms for collaborative editing scenarios.
* Handling concurrency issues and ensuring data consistency.

**Implementation:**

1. **Data Model:**
    * Define a data model to represent the document content (e.g., text, list of items).
2. **ViewModel:**
    * Utilize a shared Flow to emit document updates from any user.
    * Implement logic to apply edits received through the Flow to the local document copy.
    * Detect conflicts when edits from different users overlap.
    * Provide options for users to resolve conflicts (e.g., merge changes, choose one version).
3. **Screen:**
    * Observe the shared Flow from the ViewModel to update the displayed document content.
    * Provide input fields or editing controls for users to modify the document.
    * Upon user edits, trigger updates to the shared Flow.
    * Display conflict information and resolution options if necessary.

**Additional Notes:**

* Consider using libraries or frameworks designed for collaborative editing (e.g., Firebase Realtime Database, OTText).
* Implement optimistic locking or other techniques to prevent data inconsistencies.
* Design user-friendly interfaces for conflict resolution and version control.

**Challenge:**

* Implement real-time presence indicators for other users collaborating on the document.
* Integrate undo/redo functionality for individual user edits.

By tackling this exercise, you'll gain experience with advanced Flow functionalities and explore complex state management scenarios in collaborative editing applications.
